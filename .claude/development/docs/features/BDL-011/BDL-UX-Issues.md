## Issues

1. ~~[2026-02-13] [MEDIUM] `doctor` warns about auto-generated skeleton docs as "unlinked from graph"~~ **FIXED** — Root cause was `generate_skeletons()` writing to wrong paths (`docs/features/` instead of `docs/domains/{parent}/features/`). Fixed by using `docs:` paths from graph + correct convention fallback. Doctor now shows 0 warnings.

2. ~~[2026-02-13] [LOW] `lint` produces no output on success~~ **FIXED** — When formatter returns empty (porcelain with 0 violations), CLI now prints `"0 violations, N rules evaluated"` as confirmation.

3. ~~[2026-02-13] [LOW] `docs generate` creates skeleton files for services including the root~~ **FIXED** — Root detection changed from "empty source" to "no `part_of` edge as src". Root node is now correctly skipped regardless of source path.

4. ~~[2026-02-13] [INFO] MCP server description says "8 tools" / CLI "18 commands"~~ **FIXED** in BEAD-11 — services.yml updated to 20 commands, 9 tools.
