# ACTIVE: BDL-061 — Enforced agentic flow

> **Last updated:** 2026-08-22
> **Phase:** Development

---

## Current Bead

**Bead:** `beadloom-mr2l.25` — [dev] S1 fix: path normalisation, probe limit,
`excluded_everywhere`, dead `on:` (review `.3` returned 1 critical + 5 major; `.3` stays open)
**Goal:** close C1 and M1–M5 from review `.3`, each proven by a test that FAILS on the shipped
code — including the two defects that a GREEN test had pinned as correct.
**Done when (met):** the traversal bypass is closed and proven; the tracker probe has no page
limit and its test fails when the probe returns nothing; `excluded_everywhere` is correct in
both directions; a dead exclusion is reported; `on:` is gone from SPEC and `flow.yml` with the
harness-owned routing stated honestly.

## Progress

- [x] PRD → Approved (2026-08-22)
- [x] RFC → Approved (2026-08-22)
- [x] CONTEXT + PLAN → Approved (2026-08-22)
- [x] Epic `beadloom-mr2l` + 24 sub-beads created, linear `.1 → .24` chain wired
- [x] S1 `.1` dev — guard primitive shipped (2026-08-22): `application/guards/` +
      `beadloom guard` + logic-free Claude hook adapter + 2 guards; 68 tests, Gate green
- [x] S1 `.2` test — verdict matrix, exclusion validation, liveness widened to 248 tests
- [x] S1 `.3` review — NOT PASSING: 1 critical + 5 major + 7 minor; fix cycle opened as `.25`
- [x] S1 `.25` dev fix (2026-08-22) — C1 path traversal, M1 `excluded_everywhere`,
      m1 dead exclusion, M2 `on:` deleted, M4 `bd --limit 0`, M5 vacuous real-bd test;
      guard tests 242 → 280, Gate green on a clean DB

## Results

| Bead | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| .1 | Done | Guard primitive: registry, verdict, CLI, hook adapter, liveness (68 tests) |
| .2 | Done | Verdict matrix, exclusion validation, liveness widened (248 tests) |
| .3 | Open | Review: NOT PASSING — 1 critical + 5 major; re-review after `.25` |
| .25 | Done | S1 fix: traversal bypass, probe limit, liveness honesty, `on:` deleted |
| .26 | Pending | S1 test: independent re-verification of the bypass and the limit boundary |
| .4 | Pending | S1 tech-writer |
| .5–.8 | Pending | S2 stop the lying checks (#142, #146, #147) |
| .9–.12 | Pending | S3 composition + project overlay (#139, #152, #132, #136, #137) |
| .13–.16 | Pending | S4 BDD, mutation, doc shape + quality, shared writing standard |
| .17–.20 | Pending | S5 TO-BE / AS-IS / WORKING |
| .21–.24 | Pending | S6 waves from the graph (#155, #118, #133) |

## Notes

**Branch:** `features/BDL-061`. Slice boundary is a PR boundary — each slice green on `main`
before the next begins, as BDL-060 ran.

**Ordering is load-bearing.** S1 first because it is the primitive; S2 second because S3's
acceptance criterion is deleting the rules S2's bugs forced into the prose, which cannot happen
earlier.

**Dogfooded under itself.** From S1 onward this epic's own beads run under the guards being
written. Friction is recorded as a finding, never worked around — the record is the point.

**Deferred from review `.3`, deliberately and named:** M3 (the harness owns event routing *and*
the guard list, so `.claude/settings.json` carries two decisions Beadloom cannot see) is S3
work — it is the same defect as M2 from the other end, and wiring it hastily under a fix cycle
would recreate the "capability with no consumer" shape that M2 exists to remove. Minors m2
(no `.gitignore` entry for the firing record in scaffolded projects), m3 (`beadloom guard`
creates `.beadloom/` in a project that does not use Beadloom), m4 (the read-only digest is
narrower than its docstring claims), m5 (the dogfood matcher and the scaffolder's matcher
disagree), m6 (role files do not say the coordinator owns the commit) and m7 (no firing-record
rotation) are not in `.25` and stay for `.4`/S2.

**Carried, not forgotten:** #160 (AsyncAPI wired to nothing) stays deferred with its plan in
ROADMAP; #158 and #161 are separate items this epic's mechanisms may later absorb; #91 closes
as verified with the caveat that it is the first believable result, since only #159 taught the
cycle rule to see nested imports.

**Owner-visible checkpoint:** after `.12` (end of S3) the core request is delivered — the flow
is enforced, stops lying, and is extensible. If a later slice proves to be an epic of its own,
that gets reported rather than absorbed; S5 and S6 are the likely candidates.
